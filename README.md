NYC East Bike Database

Overview
The NYC East Bike Database provides insights into the number of bikes circulating in New York City's east region, encompassing Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and the Queensboro Bridge. The dataset covers bike counts recorded during the month of April, along with corresponding temperature and precipitation values.

Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between bike circulation and weather conditions in the NYC East area. By examining the dataset and implementing various controls, I aim to uncover patterns and correlations between different variables.

Data Cleaning
Before conducting any analysis, extensive data cleaning was performed on the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I investigated the relationship between bike circulation, temperature, and precipitation. Various visualizations and statistical analyses were employed to gain insights into patterns and trends within the dataset.
